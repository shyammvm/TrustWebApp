Weâ€™ll start by signing up to the app
Once you fill in all the user details, you can press the sign up button. This
 Will create a temporary account and send a mail to the given email address. 
On your mail there will be a confirmation link which when pressed will activate the account. 
This verify is to users email. 
After successful verification you are asked to upload a profile picture.
Then you are asked for your Facebook and Instagram profile links.
When all the details are collected you are taken to the homepage of the web app.
Here you can see the users username , their email address ,their trust core and the links to their social media profiles.
Because the user is not verified you can see the verify button below
On pressing the verify button a camera view pops up
You have to centre yourself on this view for the background algorithms to work
First algorithm that is called is the get faces programme
This program uses the haarcascade face classifier to detect faces and when a face is detected it takes several snapshots  
The next algorithm is the face matching algorithm
This algorithm converts the previous snapshot and the users profile picture into 128 bit Face encoding array
These arrays are compared and a Boolean result is returned
If the value is true the account of the user is activated
And a verified clause appears in the user profile
You can also see that the trust score of the user has also increased
There is also a search Field by which you can search all the other uses in the web app.
